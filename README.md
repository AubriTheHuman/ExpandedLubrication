Mod for 1.16.5 to expand Immersive Petroleum's lubrication system. 

Introduces Lube tiers, with configurable rate at which it will speed up machines, as well as how fast that lube tier is consumed. 
Fluids for each tier can be defined as a tag at "data/minecraft/tags/fluids/lubetierX.json", where X is the tier.

Also includes lubrication functionality for all Immersive Engineering and Immersive Petroleum machines that did no have it already, excluding the IE Assembler, Bottling Machine, and Sawmill (and unlikely they ever will be supported).

This mod was created primarily for use in the AMI modpack:
